# Audio-Based Dynamometer
## Overview
The Audio-Based Dynamometer measures engine power output using audio signals. It leverages sound analysis for accurate, real-time measurements. The system uses librosa and FFTs to get the dominant frequency, applies a high-pass filter to reduce noise, and calculates power and torque using Newton's second law with an inertia dynamometer. Data is stored on Google Drive.

## Features
- Real-Time Analysis: Provides instant feedback on engine performance.

- High Accuracy: Utilizes advanced audio processing algorithms to ensure precise measurements.

- Noise Reduction: Applies a high-pass filter to reduce noise.

- Power and Torque Calculation: Uses Newton's second law and an inertia dynamometer to calculate power and torque.

- Data Storage
