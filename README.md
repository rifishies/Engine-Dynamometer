Audio-Based Dynamometer
Overview
The Audio-Based Dynamometer measures engine power output using audio signals. It leverages sound analysis for accurate, real-time measurements. The system uses librosa and FFTs to get the dominant frequency, applies a high-pass filter to reduce noise, and calculates power and torque using Newton's second law with an inertia dynamometer. Data is stored on Google Drive.
